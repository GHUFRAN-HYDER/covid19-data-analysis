#COVID-19 Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The main dataset analyzed is a CSV file containing various metrics like confirmed cases, deaths, hospital beds, GDP, population demographics etc. for different countries and regions over time.

Key Tasks
The Jupyter notebook performs the following key tasks:

Importing libraries and loading the CSV data
Exploratory data analysis on metrics like cases, deaths, hospital beds etc.
Visualizing trends by location using plots like histograms, heatmaps, bar charts
Fitting an exponential model to cumulative cases over time
Calculating statistics like death rate and F1 score
Analyzing metrics by location and over time periods
Libraries Used
Pandas - For data manipulation and analysis
Numpy - For numerical processing
Matplotlib - For basic visualizations
Seaborn - For advanced visualizations
Usage
The notebook contains code, visualizations and explanations for the data analysis. To use:

Clone the repository
Install the required libraries
Run the Jupyter notebook
The notebook is self-contained and can be run end-to-end to reproduce the analysis. Comments are included extensively to explain the purpose and workings of each section.
